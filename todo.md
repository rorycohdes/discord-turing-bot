Nicknames
Create announcement channel instead of a plain channel if it doesn't exist already
Logic for judge to place his answer for who he/she believes is the AI
New bot for the AI
place a limit on the number of tests that can be conducted because discord only allows 10 announcements/hr for the announcement channel
make sure turing-test-chatbot doesnt have a tag
I need a role system separate and apart from the discord role functionality because roles are visible on the server's user list
I need the turing test to begin only after roles are secured for the judge and the human participant for the turing test
I need my bot (not chat-bot) to send private dms when the test begins and after all roles have been secured. It should also to them there role and run by instructions on how to play/ take part in the test
I need to write code so that I can't join the test with the same username
I also need to write code so that a warning is sent when you try to set the nickname of someone with a higher server privellege than you
instructions in dm should explain what to do when you get in the channel
First thing I want is for the channel to be told who the judge is by nickname
